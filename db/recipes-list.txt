**Bacon Wrapped Cream Cheese Crackers**
----------------- 
INGREDIENTS:
- 2 lbs of bacon (just regular, don't use the thick cut)
- 60 Club Crackers (about 2 sleeves)
- 1 (8 oz.) block of cream cheese, softened (reduced fat is fine)
----------------- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
(Part 1) 
1 - Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Prepare 2 pans (that can fit side-by-side in the oven) by covering them with foil. Then place a cooling rack or broiling rack on top of the pan. Spray with cooking spray.
2 - Spread cream cheese onto each cracker. I used about a teaspoon each, but really don't overthink the amount. Just spread it on, but not too thin.
3 - Cut the bacon in half. Wrap each cracker with a half piece of bacon.
4 - Place each wrapped cracker onto the prepared racks on the pans.
5 - Bake for 2 hours.
